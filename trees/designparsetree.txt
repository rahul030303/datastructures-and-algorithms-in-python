Using the information from above we can define four rules as follows:

If the current token is a '(', add a new node as the left child of the current node, and descend to the left child.

If the current token is in the list ['+','-','/','*'], set the root value of the current node to the operator represented by the current token. Add a new node as the right child of the current node and descend to the right child.

If the current token is a number, set the root value of the current node to the number and return to the parent.

If the current token is a ')', go to the parent of the current node.
